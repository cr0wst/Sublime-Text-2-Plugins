is currently a WIP and will probably break.

* Add python 3.x support (untested, only tested with 2.x)
* Drink more coffee

* * You can get your API Key at http://thepb.in/p/auth
* If you would like to change the keybinding (default is ctrl+d) this can be done in the Default.sublime-keymap file.

SETTINGS
There are a few optional settings in ThePB.sublime-settings:
* LOCK_PASS contains a password to lock all pastes sent using this plugin
* IS_PRIV when set to 1 sends your pastes as private (Caution: All paste information is sent via plain-text)
* PASTE_DESC gives a default description to your paste
